## Updated JSON-LD Schema
This folder represents the draft of a new annotation schema in json-ld. 

### Objectives
The goal of this shift is to both have an object-oriented schema that better enables selection of a subset of terms and also de-couples the metadata schema from the ontology.

### General Structure
The structure follows the HCA-metadata schema in theory to facilitate future integration

#### Directories
`core/`: These are the essential elements of each entity.
`type/`: These are types of the core entities.
`module/`: No modules yet
`ontologies/`: In this directory we maintain the values for the keys defined in the schema and update as needed.
