LOAD1 is a mouse strain that has two copies of the APOE4 gene and two copies of the Trem2R47H gene. The APOE4 gene is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, and the Trem2R47H gene is a modifier of the risk of Alzheimer's disease. LOAD2 is a mouse strain that has two copies of the APOE4 and Trem2R47H genes, as well as two copies of the Abeta gene. The Abeta gene is a protein that is thought to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Both LOAD1 and LOAD2 mice are more likely develop Alzheimer's disease at a younger age than mice with other genotypes. This makes the LOAD1 and LOAD2 genotypes valuable tools for studying the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease.",
